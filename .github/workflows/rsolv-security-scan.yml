# TEMPLATE: RSOLV Simple Security Scan
#
# ✅ PROVEN WORKING TEMPLATE - Based on successful nodegoat deployment
# Runtime: ~52 seconds for 50-100 files
#
# QUICK START:
# 1. Copy this file to: .github/workflows/rsolv-security-scan.yml
# 2. Add secret to your repo: Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
#    Name: RSOLV_API_KEY
#    Value: Your RSOLV API key
# 3. Commit and push - workflow will run automatically on push to master
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - RSOLV_API_KEY secret (required for pattern fetching)
# - Write permissions for issues (to create vulnerability reports)
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# - Scans your repository for security vulnerabilities
# - Creates GitHub Issues for findings with 'rsolv:detected' label
# - Completes in under 1-2 minutes for typical repositories
#
# IMPORTANT: Use v3.7.47 or later. Earlier versions (v3.6.x) have infinite loop bugs.

name: RSOLV Security Scan

on:
  # Manual trigger from Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Automatic trigger on push to master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]
    # Optional: Only run when Python files change
    # paths:
    #   - '**/*.py'

permissions:
  contents: read      # Read repository files
  issues: write       # Create issues for vulnerabilities

jobs:

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Run RSOLV security scan
      # This uses the published GitHub Action (recommended approach)
      # No Docker building required - much faster!
      - name: RSOLV Scan - Detect Vulnerabilities
        uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@v3.7.47  # ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use v3.7.47+
        with:
          rsolvApiKey: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
          mode: 'scan'  # Options: scan, validate, mitigate, full
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Automatically provided

      # Step 3: Report completion
      - name: Scan Summary
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "✅ Security scan complete"
          echo "Check the Issues tab for vulnerabilities with 'rsolv:detected' label"
          echo "View detailed logs in the workflow run output"

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
#
# If workflow hangs or times out:
# - Ensure you're using v3.7.47 or later (v3.6.x has bugs)
# - Check that RSOLV_API_KEY secret is set correctly
# - Verify repository doesn't have excessive files (1000+)
#
# Expected performance for Python/Flask apps:
# - Docker build: ~30 seconds (cached after first run)
# - Scanning: 5-30 seconds depending on file count
# - Total runtime: 45-90 seconds for typical repos
#
# Expected vulnerabilities for Vulnerable-Flask-App:
# - SQL injection
# - Command injection
# - Insecure deserialization
# - XSS vulnerabilities
